description: Pinia stores that look like API-driven state
globs:
  - "stores/**/*.ts"
---

- `defineStore` with typed `state/getters/actions`.
- Actions call **services**; handle `isLoading`, `hasError`, `errorMessage`.
- Support **optimistic updates** for create/update/remove; roll back on failure.
- No direct seed access; all data flows through the service layer.
- Provide **selectors** for derived state to keep components dumb.
