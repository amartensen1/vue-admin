description: Component authoring rules (global, reusable)
globs:
  - "components/**/*.vue"
---

- Single responsibility; extract logic to `composables/`.
- Typed props; minimal surface. Use `defineEmits` for outputs.
- Prefer computed state over branching templates; avoid long `v-if/else if` chains.
- No direct store mutations inside atoms/molecules; bubble actions via emits.
