description: Prototype mode (mock services, no server routes)
globs:
  - "**/*"
---

- Do **not** create real server routes under `server/` or call external APIs.
- All "API" access goes through a **client-side mock service layer** in `services/` that returns Promises and simulates latency/errors.
- Stores depend on services; components depend on stores (components never import seed data directly).
