# Purpose
Adopt **Atomic Design** (atoms → molecules → organisms → templates → pages) while ensuring **platform-wide reusability** of UI components.

# Coexistence & Precedence (avoid rule conflicts)
- If another rule (design system, accessibility, testing, or naming) **contradicts** guidance here, **defer to the more specific rule** scoped to that package or directory.
- Do **not** re-implement primitives already provided by the project’s design system. Prefer **wrappers** around existing tokens/components.
- Keep this rule **UI-only**: no data fetching, routing, analytics, or app-specific logic.
